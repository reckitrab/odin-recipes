# odin-recipes

Project Overview
As part of the Odin Project introductory course I have been tasked with creating a basic website with recipes.

I have added Mince & Tatties, Lasagna and Chicken Fajitas.
this has allowed me to demonstrate using both Ordered and Unordered lists, Links and Images whilst also managing my filesystem to accomodate the pages and images in relevant folders all while processing git commits and pushing changes.
